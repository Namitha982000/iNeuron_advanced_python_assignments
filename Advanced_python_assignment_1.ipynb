    "In order to provide a structured and efficient method of organising and managing code, Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) strives to mimic real-world objects and their interactions. OOP allows for the modular, reusable, and maintainable design and construction of software systems.\n",
    "The core principles of Python's OOP are:\n",
    "1. Classes: Classes act as models or models for the creation of objects. They specify the properties (data) and actions (methods) that class objects may have.\n",
    "2. Objects: Instances of classes make up objects. They represent distinct entities, each of which has a particular collection of data and behaviour. By calling methods or gaining access to properties, objects can communicate with one another.\n",
    "3. Encapsulation: Within a class, encapsulation is the grouping of data (attributes) and functions (methods). It makes information possible."

    "The inheritance search in Python looks for a property when it is accessed on an object in a particular order known as the Method Resolution Order (MRO). The order in which Python looks for characteristics in a class hierarchy is specified by the MRO. The C3 linearization algorithm, which is based on the idea of a directed acyclic graph, is used to calculate the MRO.\n",
    "Following the MRO, the inheritance search for an attribute looks in the following locations, in that order:\n",
    "1. The instance itself: Python first looks for the attribute directly on the instance of the object. If the attribute is found, the search stops, and that value is returned.\n",
    "2. The class of the instance: If the attribute is not found on the instance, Python then looks for the attribute in the class of the object. If the attribute is found in the class, the search stops, and that value is returned.\n",
    "3. Parent classes in the inheritance hierarchy: If the attribute is not found in the instance or the class, Python continues the search in the parent classes according to the MRO. It follows a depth-first, left-to-right traversal of the inheritance graph. The search stops as soon as the attribute is found in one of the parent classes. If the attribute is not found in any parent class, a `AttributeError` is raised.\n",
    "It's crucial to remember that the order in which the base classes are stated in the class declaration using the inheritance syntax determines the MRO. The'mro()' method on a class or accessing the '__mro__' attribute can be used to look at the MRO.\n",
    "Overall, Python's inheritance search is consistent and predictable, allowing for the inheritance and overriding of attributes in the class hierarchy of an object as required."
