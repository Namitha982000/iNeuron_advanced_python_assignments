    "Both `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` are special methods in Python that are called when an attribute is accessed on an object. However, there is a significant difference between them:\n",
    "1. `__getattr__(self, name)`: This method is called when an attribute that doesn't exist is accessed. It allows you to define custom behavior for handling attribute access for non-existing attributes. It takes two parameters: `self` (the instance of the object) and `name` (the name of the attribute being accessed).\n",
    "   If `__getattr__` is defined in a class, it is only called when a non-existing attribute is accessed. It is not called for existing attributes or for special methods (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`). This method is generally used for implementing \"attribute lookup fallback\" behavior or handling dynamic attributes.\n",
    "   Here's an example:"

It is called before `__getattr__` and allows you to define custom behavior for attribute access, including existing attributes and special methods. This method is typically used for implementing attribute access control or performing additional actions on attribute access.\n",

    "Properties and descriptors are both mechanisms in Python that allow you to define controlled access to attributes of an object. However, there are some differences between them:\n",
    "Properties:\n",
    "- Properties are a high-level feature provided by Python that allow you to define special methods (getter, setter, and deleter) for attribute access.\n",
    "- Properties are defined on a per-attribute basis within a class, using the `@property`, `@attribute_name.setter`, and `@attribute_name.deleter` decorators.\n",
    "- Properties provide a clean and straightforward syntax for attribute access, making it appear like accessing a regular attribute.\n",
    "- Properties are usually defined within the class where the attribute is being accessed or modified.\n",
    "- Properties are specific to the attributes they are defined for, and each attribute can have its own getter, setter, and deleter methods.\n",
    "- Properties can be used to add additional behavior or logic when accessing or modifying attributes, such as validation or computation.\n",
    "Descriptors:\n",
    "- Descriptors are a lower-level feature in Python that allows you to define how attribute access and modification are handled using special methods defined in a separate descriptor class.\n",
    "- Descriptors are defined as separate classes that implement at least one of the descriptor methods: `__get__()`, `__set__()`, or `__delete__()`.\n",
    "- Descriptors are typically defined outside the class where the attribute is being accessed or modified.\n",
    "- Descriptors can be shared across multiple attributes or even multiple classes.\n",
    "- Descriptors allow more fine-grained control over attribute access, as they can define behavior for multiple attributes simultaneously.\n",
    "- Descriptors can be used to implement custom attribute access patterns, enforce access restrictions, or define computed attributes.\n",
    "In summary, properties provide a convenient and high-level way to define controlled attribute access within a class, while descriptors offer lower-level control and flexibility for managing attribute access and modification across multiple attributes or classes. Properties are often used for simple attribute access control and behavior, while descriptors are more suitable for advanced scenarios that require fine-grained control over attribute handling."
