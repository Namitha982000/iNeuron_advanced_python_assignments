    "Before using the index() method to identify a substring, checking the target string using the \"in\" or \"not in\" operator might have numerous advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Avoiding Errors: The 'in' or 'not in' operator allows you to determine whether the substring is present in the target string before attempting to determine its index. By doing this, it is possible to prevent problems that can arise if the substring is missing from the target string. When utilising the \"index()\" method, you can handle the situation graciously without resulting in a \"ValueError\" if the substring is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improved Efficiency: In general, the 'in' or 'not in' operator is more effective than the 'index()' technique since it conducts a quick membership check. The 'in' operator determines whether the substring is present or absent in the target string, whereas the 'index()' method conducts a linear search to locate the substring's first appearance. The overhead of needless searching when the substring is absent can be avoided by conducting the membership check first.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Code Readability: Including a membership check with `in` or `not in` before using the `index()` method provides clarity to the code and enhances its readability. It makes it clear that before performing any additional operations, you are checking to see if the substring exists.\n"
