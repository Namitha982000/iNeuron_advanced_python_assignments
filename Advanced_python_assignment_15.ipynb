    "Python 3.8 introduced several new features and improvements. Here are some notable additions in Python 3.8:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assignment Expressions (the Walrus operator): This feature allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression. It uses the := operator. For example: `while (line := f.readline()) != 'end':`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Positional-only parameters: You can now define function parameters that can only be passed by position, not by keyword. This allows you to enforce certain parameter ordering and simplify function signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `math.prod()` function: This function returns the product of all elements in an iterable. It provides a convenient way to calculate the product without needing to use a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The `f-strings` debugging feature: You can now use `=` within f-strings to display both the variable name and its value for debugging purposes. For example: `f'{x=}, {y=}'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The `typing.final` decorator: This decorator allows you to indicate that a class or function is intended to be \"effectively final,\" meaning it should not be subclassed or overridden.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Improved syntax warnings and error messages: Python 3.8 introduced more helpful and informative error messages and warnings, making it easier to debug and understand code issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The `statistics.mode()` function: This function calculates the mode (most common value) of a list of numbers in the `statistics` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The `functools.cache()` decorator: This decorator provides a simple way to cache the results of a function, saving computation time for repeated calls with the same arguments."

    "The term \"monkey patching\" describes the process of adding, altering, or changing characteristics, methods, or functions of already-existing objects or classes in order to modify or expand code at runtime. It enables you to alter code's behaviour without altering the original source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Python supports dynamically changing objects and classes, monkey patching is possible. You can change the behaviour of built-in classes or functions or even add new methods or attributes to an existing object or class. Other options include replacing existing methods or properties with new implementations.\n",

    "Monkey patching can be useful in certain situations, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Without waiting for a formal update, repairing problems or adding missing functionality in third-party libraries or modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Developing new features through experimentation or prototyping without changing the original codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using band-aid repairs or workarounds until an appropriate solution is put into place.\n",
