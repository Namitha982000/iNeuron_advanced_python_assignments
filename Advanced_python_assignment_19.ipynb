    "In a class, a method is a function that is designated and connected to objects (instances) of that class. It can access or modify the state of specific instances while operating on the data (attributes) of the class. A method is a function that is a part of a class, to put it simply.\n",

    "1. Associated with a Class: A method is specified in the class block and is connected to a class. It is intended to function on the characteristics and actions of instances of that class. A normal function, on the other hand, is autonomous and unattached to any particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Access to Instance Data: Through the unique'self' parameter, methods gain access to the instance data (attributes) of the class. This makes it possible for methods to communicate with and alter the state of certain instances. Regular functions cannot access instance data by default; they must be explicitly supplied as arguments.\n",

    "3. Inheritance: Subclasses are capable of inheriting methods. A class that is descended from another class inherits all of the parent class's methods. As a result, it is possible to reuse code, and subclasses can expand and inherit the parent class's behaviour. Other functions do not necessarily inherit regular functions.\n",
