    "To support iteration in your classes, you can use the following two operator overloading methods:\n",
    "1. `__iter__(self)`: This method is called when an iterator object is created for the class. It should return an iterator object that defines the `__next__()` method. The `__iter__()` method is responsible for setting up the necessary state for iteration.\n",
    "2. `__next__(self)`: This method is called by the iterator object to retrieve the next item in the iteration. It should return the next item in the iteration or raise the `StopIteration` exception to signal the end of iteration.\n",

    "Operator overloading is appropriate to use in situations where it enhances the clarity, expressiveness, and usability of your code. Here are some scenarios where operator overloading can be beneficial:\n",
    "1. Emulating Built-in Types: Operator overloading allows you to make your custom classes behave like built-in types, such as numbers or containers. This can make your code more intuitive and readable, as it leverages the familiarity of the operators to perform relevant operations on your objects.\n",
    "2. Domain-Specific Operations: If your class represents a domain-specific concept or data structure, operator overloading can provide a natural way to perform operations that are specific to that domain. For example, you might overload the `+` operator for a Vector class to perform vector addition.\n",
    "3. Code Readability: Operator overloading can make your code more readable and concise by allowing you to express operations using familiar syntax. This can improve the overall readability and maintainability of your code, especially when working with complex algorithms or mathematical operations.\n",
    "4. API Design: Operator overloading can contribute to designing a user-friendly API for your class. By providing intuitive operator behavior, users of your class can perform operations on objects in a natural and concise way, leading to more readable and expressive code.\n",
    "However, it's important to use operator overloading judiciously and in a way that adheres to the principle of least surprise. Operator overloading should be used when it provides clear and meaningful semantics and does not lead to confusion or unexpected behavior. It's recommended to follow established conventions and guidelines for operator overloading in the programming language you are using to ensure consistency and maintainability of your code.\n",
    "Remember that operator overloading is a powerful tool, but it should be used responsibly and with careful consideration of the specific requirements and design goals of your code."
